  HTML is <i>reasonably</i> straightforward. I am going to learn 
about it at <a href="udacity.com">udacity</a>.

<p><b>HTML</b> is the <em>core</em> of the internet and holds every 
other type of file. 
It stands for <i>hyper text markup language</i>. 
A <i>hyperlink</i> is what connects things and makes them 'web-like'.</p>

<p>There are the main pieces; the browser, the internet, and servers using http protocol to communicate.

<br><br>HTML is made of:

<br>Text content (what you see)
<br>markup (what it looks like)
<br>references to other documents (images or videos)
<br>links
</p>
<p>Markup is made up of <b>tags</b>. opening/ closing tags

<br>[tag] text [/tag]
<br><br>
the whole thing is called an <i>element</i>
<br>
[b] bold<br>
[em] emphasis (italic)<br><br>

If you skip an ending tag, everything after is that state.</p>

<p>HTML <b>attributes</b> are a property of an element.<br>

[tag attribute="value"]  contents [/tag]

<br><br>for example the link tag anchor:<br>

[a href="www.reddit.com"] derp [/a]<br>
</p><p> The image tag:<br>
[img src="url" alt="text"]<br>

<u>alt Text</u> is <i>technically</i> required. Nice for blind people.<br>
<br>A VOID tag has no content. img tag has no closing tag<br>

all spaces turn into one space so you need the [br] tag.  It's a void tag, too.
<br>
[p] is for paragraph. Not void. [p] content [/p]
</p><p>

{br} is inline.  	{p} is block. It makes an invisible box w/ height & width. 

{b}, {em}, {img} are all inline. So far {p} is the only block element covered.</p>
<p>
[span] & [div] are two container tags. The are used for CSS and organization.

[Span] is inline and [div] is block<br><br>

[span class="foo"] text [/span]<br>
[div class="bar"] text [/div]</p>
